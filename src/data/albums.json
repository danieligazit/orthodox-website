          "Another year, another Valentine’s Day—Ljungsberg returns with Do I Care, a reimagining of her cult album I Do Care (ORTH001). Released exactly one year later, this album doesn’t just revisit its predecessor; it reflects on its emotional and structural foundations while questioning the role of music as an act of care in an uncertain world.",
          "Originally conceived as a way to adapt I Do Care for live performance, the project quickly evolved into a deeper exploration: can a finished work remain open to transformation? Do I Care stretches and blurs the edges between flux, continuity, and reinvention—not a sequel, nor a departure, but a counterpoint embracing process and fluidity.",
          "Ljungsberg’s background in Musique Concrète and electro-acoustic techniques remains central as she reshapes and manipulates her own pre-recorded songs. Fragmented loops weave through the melodies and textures of I Do Care, while her ethereal voice lingers—both grounding and re-evoking her intimate sonic world.",
          "More than a reinterpretation, Do I Care signals a shift—introducing doubt into the emotional and creative process. It is a meditation on transformation, where care and uncertainty coexist, and music remains in a state of becoming."

          "The shapeshifting hellscapes of Wackelkontakt (Tomer Damsky aka MC Slice, Marco Milevski Tomasin, and Eyal Lally Bitton) return with new garments in their second album Change the Process, on a collaborative release between Orthodox (France) & JauneOrange (Belgium).",
          "Attempts to define Wackelkontakt’s singular sound resulted in definitions such as Psychotrap and Doom R&B, with their debut album being acclaimed for its dynamism and reluctance to stick to one genre. In Change the Process, the group broadens the palette of styles even further. It is a collection of fragments: each song in the album sets a distinct mental scene, as if created by a different author. As the song sequence unfolds, it paves a journey between psycho-sensory states. Emblematic of Wackelkontakt’s genre-defiant artistry, Change the Process does not conform to a single theme but flourishes as a multiple entity, a schizophrenic crossroads of influences where each pathway gives birth to an encounter with an ever-weirder facet of human consciousness.",
          "The album’s musical universe is set in the enchanted forest of ancient fantasies and proto-narratives: a liminal space of transformation, harboring both unknown dangers and a refuge from the world. A story unfinished and unfinishable, it moves from symbol to allegory; it comes and goes, crossing through various realms of the conceptual imagination, on a route spread over time and space, to be ultimately left pending.",
          "In Change the Process Wackelkontakt steer the heavy, noise-influenced sound of their debut album into a more melodic terrain. They evolved into a new mutation, melting together drone, industrial, and metal aesthetics with bleak soundscapes and soulful laments. Milevski’s blasting percussion, a hybrid of acoustic drums and sample-based beats, couple with Damsky’s sensitive yet intensive vocals to form the core musical storytelling: moving, affective, and at times downright terrifying. The album’s lyrics are Damsky’s characteristic mash of biblical verse and taunting self-irony, uttered in an array of vocal deliveries: terse whispers, spitting rap, and venomous screeches alongside hopeful melodies and cantorial Arabesque. A new addition to Wackelkontakt’s sonic arsenal, the string instruments are woven throughout the story as a cinematic motif, an echo of the emotional states the songs attempt to tackle.",
          "In ever-evolving ways to communicate with their audience, Wackelkontakt will release the album alongside a 35-minute short film, an audiovisual poem filmed in four countries. It features their signature visual-sonic storytelling, smashing together visceral docu-fiction, psycho-drama, mytho-poetics, and religious symbolism. "

Turn of a Millstone is the debut studio album from SEVELLE, a trio consisting of sculptor and sound artist Niv Gafni (DIY bagpipe), musician and designer Daniel Treystman (drums), and musician Shaul Kohn (guitar).",
          "Initially drawing their influences from Tony Conrad & Faust’s insights over drone minimalism and krautrock’s cosmic rhythm — Turn of a Millstone continue to rotate endlessly, paving the road of krautdrone’s foundations, they are opening a passage into an immersive dimension where minimalism becomes maximalism. The trio constructs parallel sonic plateaus—each locked in its own repetition, yet constantly evolving, grinding forward with a force that is both oppressive and liberating.",
          "Their practice of continuous playing is a trial of physical and mental limits, a controlled collapse into chaos. The spiking drones and pounding rhythms resonate with the tension between order and entropy, structure and dissolution. In this space, Sevelle enacts a ritual of sonic self-sacrifice—driving themselves to exhaustion in pursuit of something beyond the self.",
          "Like the turning of a grinding wheel, Turn of a Millstone is demanding yet deeply rewarding, revealing itself through endurance, through surrender. A meditation on repetition, failure, and transcendence—this is music at its breaking point.",
          "Released as part of ROOMS, a new series on ORTHODOX dedicated to long-form sound works. Each release in this series is issued on cassette, with both sides carrying the same recording—an infinite loop of sound, a space to dwell in, leave, and return to. "

          "\"words don’t come easy\" is the first album by the new duo IMMA, rooted in a shared sonic curiosity between electroacoustic singer-songwriter Daniella Ljungsberg and multimedia artist and composer Itzik Gil Avizohar.",
          "While each comes from a different musical world, one shaped by voice, intimacy, and traces of Nordic folklore; the other by distorted sound walls and sonic intensities drawn from a deep fascination with metal culture, their collaboration reveals a mutual attunement to the haunting presence of sound. Like distant echoes of traditions, this album is less about stylistic fusion than about an ever-evolving friendship.",
          "Together, they hold polarities in tension with a consonant sensitivity: vast sonic spaces, emotional density, and the quiet pull of things held just before they collapse. Their music moves along blurred edges, between structured songs and polished sketches, free improvisation and defined form. Ljungsberg’s voice and subtly addictive melodies lead like a ray of light through the dense spectral fog shaped by Avizohar’s synthesis, sparsely unfolding across his repetitive basslines.",

          "Over the past two decades, Cadaver Eyes have been exploring the experimental terrains introduced by John Cage and Gordon Mumma, using unpredictable electronic systems to crack apart and access sheer cosmic openness, and then harness the emergent dynamic forces through the propulsive and cemented structures of Extreme Metal and Hardcore Punk. Playing instruments that act in surprising and unexpected ways, their musical task is daunting: to write songs that reveal themselves differently and that are manifested anew every time they are performed, resulting in a total immersive sonic experience - heavy, pounding, and punishing. Cadaver Eyes' sensory overload operates on the primal substrate of our creature selves, acting on the very mechanisms that situate us in the world.",
          "ROAD EXTENDS is the result of a long and arduous process of trying to translate this intense sonorous experience into a recorded format. Originally titled Best Kind, this album initially dealt with the pain and suffering experienced at the most writhing and primal levels of existence, touching upon the coercive experience of being flooded by an overwhelming dehumanizing barrage of information undergone by people living in our age of accelerated capitalism. The album still addresses all these themes; but over the long stretch of time, another, very personal layer, had accumulated and became deeply infused in the underlying essence of this album: life. Life in its hardships and its tribulations, its turns and its crises and the traumatizing scars that it leaves upon us.",

          "Celebrating ORTHODOX's first release with 'I Do Care', a stunning debut by composer, producer and singer Daniella Ljungsberg, a sort of musician whose definition is elusive, but if we had to insist we would simply define her as captivating. With her unique ethereal voice, she expresses a warm invitation, a welcoming gesture into her sonic world. ",
          "Ljungsberg’s comes from an experimental musical background, where she spent her last years exploring electro acoustic techniques, with an emphasis on the field of Musique Concréte, by extensively using field recordings and acoustic instrumentation heavily processed into digital loops and granulations in order to create fragmental sonic environments. ",
          "In 'I Do Care', Daniella unveils her biographical artistic journey by returning to her origins, and in particular, to her childhood memories in Sweden. The album is composed of sample based songs, inspired by nordic folklore, returning to the most primal and basic forms of composition such as loops, lucid melodies and harmonies interwoven with Ljungsberg’s iconic vocals. A musical odyssey that traverses realms of compassion, humor and sentimentality, forming a musical collage that lingers between, Folk, Dream-pop and Lo-fi Ambient.",
          "'I Do Care' invites us into Ljugnsberg's haunted world, not only by its spectrality, but by its sense of nostalgia, as if we share a collective memory. The familiarity embedded within her music tenderly guides us back home, even if we hadn’t realized we'd left it."

          "What happens when your neuroses come to life? What shapes will they take?",
          " ‘From Behind the Door’ is a concept album by composer Na’ama Zisser, stemming from her original soundtrack for LUSUS (2023), a psychological horror anthology by BBC Radio 4. Set in a dreamlike state between sleep and wakefulness, the album delves into themes of inner demons, modern-day fears and anxieties, and their physical manifestations. ",
          "Crafted in intimate settings with just a handful of collaborators, the album unveils an atmospheric soundscape that navigates through a myriad of existential states. It depicts a world that feels simultaneously suffocating and spacious, tranquil yet deeply unsettling—harmoniously discordant. Its minimalistic lo-fi approach intertwines subtle vocal drones, delicate whispers, and disembodied voices with the warmth of nostalgic analog synths and creaking out-of-tune pianos captured via iPhone memos. ",
          "At the heart of ‘From Behind the Door’ lies the human voice, serving as a central character. As the music unfolds, listeners are drawn into an auditory labyrinth that oscillates between serene void and mental chaos, as Zisser leads us through a sonic journey that explores the depths of our inner disorders."
