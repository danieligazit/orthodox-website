          "ROAD EXTENDS, the latest offering from Cadaver Eyes on ORTHODOX, is a bold and challenging release from the veteran duo of drummer/vocalist David Opp (BARBARA, Carnation Dingthang, Heart & Crossbone Records) and no-input-mixer virtuoso Eran \"Zax\" Sachs (Dumitrescu's Hyperion Ensemble, Asher.Zax).",
          "Over the past two decades, Cadaver Eyes have been exploring the experimental terrains introduced by John Cage and Gordon Mumma, using unpredictable electronic systems to crack apart and access sheer cosmic openness, and then harness the emergent dynamic forces through the propulsive and cemented structures of Extreme Metal and Hardcore Punk. Playing instruments that act in surprising and unexpected ways, their musical task is daunting: to write songs that reveal themselves differently and that are manifested anew every time they are performed, resulting in a total immersive sonic experience - heavy, pounding, and punishing. Cadaver Eyes' sensory overload operates on the primal substrate of our creature selves, acting on the very mechanisms that situate us in the world.",
          "ROAD EXTENDS is the result of a long and arduous process of trying to translate this intense sonorous experience into a recorded format. Originally titled Best Kind, this album initially dealt with the pain and suffering experienced at the most writhing and primal levels of existence, touching upon the coercive experience of being flooded by an overwhelming dehumanizing barrage of information undergone by people living in our age of accelerated capitalism. The album still addresses all these themes; but over the long stretch of time, another, very personal layer, had accumulated and became deeply infused in the underlying essence of this album: life. Life in its hardships and its tribulations, its turns and its crises and the traumatizing scars that it leaves upon us.",
